## Project Evolution

**v1.0 - Original Goal:**
- Build a Chrome extension that adds a toggle to switch charts on MacroMicro.me into dark theme
- Charts on MacroMicro.me for example:

  https://www.macromicro.me/charts/109709/big-techs-m7-capex
- Charts in dark theme like how they do:

**v2.0 - Enhanced Goal:**
- Expanded to work on ANY website, not just MacroMicro.me
- Adaptive dark theme toggle that activates only on sites without native dark modes
- Smart detection prevents conflicts with existing dark themes
- Special optimizations for charts and data visualizations
- Works on financial sites, dashboards, documentation, news, etc.
- Better user experience with broader applicability and intelligent behavior
